    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll go through a short quiz containing the types of questions about SQL and relational databases that you can expect to see in an interview. \n",

    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "INTEGER, REAL, TEXT BLOB\n",
    "\n",
    "The type system of SQLite3 allows it to function with other common type systems from other SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Keys are unique keys assigned to each entry in a table. Foreign Keys are column values that are used to align with Primary Keys of another table. Joining two tables with Primary Keys and Foreign Keys can add additional rows and/or columns of data to the original table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "One-to-One: Each entry in a table is linked to only one entry in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-to-Many: Each entry in a table is linked to multiple entries in another tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many-to-Many: Multiple entries in one table are linked to multiple entries in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "INNER JOIN: Joins two tables where a key in the first table matches a key in the second table and returns values of matching keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "OUTER JOIN: Joins two tables where there are matching and unmatching rows and returns values based on whether FULL, LEFT, or RIGHT OUTER JOIN is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "LEFT JOIN: Joins two tables where the second table has keys matching in the first table, returning the full first table along with matches from the second table. NULL values are added where keys do not match.\n",
    "\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN: The reverse of LEFT JOIN. SQLite does not recognize RIGHT JOIN.\n",
    "\n",
    "FULL JOIN: Joins two tables, entirely, returning values for matching and unmatching keys and adding NULL values to unmatching keys. SQLite does not recognize FULL JOIN.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate functions are used for mathematical calculations of sets of data to return single values. In SQL, it is normally used with GROUP BY in order to specify the exact dataset in which to perform the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Associate Entities act as a link between two tables to be able to perform many-to-many JOIN statements. They allow for easy organization of keys to where one table can use such keys as a relay to join with another table in which it has no key relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
